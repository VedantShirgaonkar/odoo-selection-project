## 📌 Project Overview

**ReWear** is a web-based platform that enables users to:

- 👕 List unused clothes for exchange  
- 🔁 Swap items directly with other users  
- 🎯 Redeem clothing using a **point-based system**  

The goal is to build a **community-oriented solution** to help users reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them, creating a more **eco-friendly** approach to fashion.
